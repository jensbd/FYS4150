# Project 5

Compile `main.cpp` as `c++ -O3 -fopenmp -o <executable> main.cpp Functions.cpp` and run with `./<executable>`

All plots are then produced by running `python3 plotter.py`

Unit test: Compile `Unit_test.cpp` as `c++ -fopenmp -O3 -o <executable> Unit_test.cpp Functions.cpp` and run with `./<executable>`.

The folders and structure in this repository is needed for the programs to run correctly.
